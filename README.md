## Algorithm of biggest in 5 numbers
### step 1
#### we need to get a user input of how many numbers to be added in the list.
### step 2
#### Then we have to create a empty list
### step 3 
#### after this iterate a for loop in the range of (0,n)
### step 4
#### Then we have to append  this in the empty list by using a list properity
### step 5 
#### Then we can find a maximum number of list by using a inbuild function ,max(list) it will return a maximum of given list.

## Algorithm of palindrome string
### step 1
#### We need to get a user input of any string.
### step 2
#### Then we have to create  a variable which is having a empty value ,(i,e) y =""
### step 3
#### after this iterate a for loop in the string, then we have to add this string to y ,(i,e) y = i+y
### step 4
#### Then we have to compare this variable to sting by using if statement,if the statement is true the given string is palindrome.
